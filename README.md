Wrapper script for Neovide + nvim on macOS

Until [this feature]( https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1586) is implemented in [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/) it's a bit tricky to open a file from command line in an already open Neovide window. Or setting `$EDITOR` to Neovide for that matter. Hence this script.
